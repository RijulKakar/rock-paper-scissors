# rock-paper-scissors-ai

Hey everyone! This project is all about data collection, data analysis, and using data to program an AI for rock paper scissors. Through this project, everyone involved will learn many skills related to and a part of computer science. (More description...)

# weekly-meeting
Meetings will be either on Monday or Wednesday depending on everyone's availability around 6-7pm.

# member-expectations
As for expectations, you are not expected to know much about AI or anything along those lines. But, a good attitude and a willingness to learn is something that would be very good to have. And as we are the project managers, we will also try and learn from everyone else, since there are going to be some people that are very knowledgable in many topics.
